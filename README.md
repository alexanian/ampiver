SYDE 361 project - a smart grid sensor for ice accretion

from the Spring 2015 offering of SYDE 361. The project was a sensor to take the
place of smart grid current sensors at various points in the electrical grid and
broadcast temperature, humidity and ice presence. This allows grid management to
be warned of and alerted to icing events.

A UI mockup can be found on the gh-pages branch.
Uses the [PipetteTech DHT Library](https://github.com/piettetech/PietteTech_DHT)
to read DHT22 temperature and humidity values from the Spark Core.
